    bio: `My career started with freelance writing in 2019. I wrote on everything from gift guides, crypto, forex, landing page, blog posts, articles and many more. I daresay there's hardly anything I didn't write about during that stage of my career. This helped me develop a strong foundation in diverse writing styles, tones, voices and subjects.

Fueled by a strong desire to advocate for women's health, I volunteered as a content strategist and writer at Gynix Africa. I spread my wings and managed the Twitter account as well. This pushed me into learning the basics of social media marketing, despite dabbling into it over the years.

Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with some of Nigeria's most influential media platforms and Tech startups like TalentX, including my current home, Pulse Nigeria.

At Pulse, I act in the full capacity of an SEO writer and content strategist to create articles that reach thousands of readers daily. Beyond clicks and other metrics, my work resonates with and helps readers understand what's happening around them, make better and informed decisions.

I believe that in an age of artificial intelligence, human-centered storytelling is more valuable than ever. I specialize in taking complex narratives and making them accessible, engaging, and above all, human.`,
